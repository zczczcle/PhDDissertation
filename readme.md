So, in this *PRIVATE* repo, my PhD Dissertation will be traced.

1. I can trace my progress from contributions and Graphs>Punch card. 
2. History function. 
3. It's saved in reliable cloud. `not onedrive`

##What I may/shoud do here
1.  Paste tex files here everyday as a 'call it a day'. 
2.  Trace my updates. 
3.  Download or export things from here. 

##What I don't do here
1. Figures (Prepare original ai/svg/wmf and exported pdf)
2. Formats (Do it in ShareLatex, or Microsoft Word)
3. References.bib (BibTex file can be exported by Mendeley!)
