# My PhD_Dissertation 

Here is my PhD dissertation \LaTeX source under GNU Public licence. 
Please note that many of the codes are not written by me but from other open-sources.

##*Why* I put things here? 
1. I can trace my progress by the Github with full history. 
2. I would like to make it open-source, which might benefit others. 

##Make use of it
If you would like to make use of some \LaTeX source codes of it, especially if you are a PhD student from University of Tsukuba, you are encouraged to use it only when you agree these statements: 

1.  You also follow GNU Public licencing. 
2.  I am not responsible for any problem of your dissertation. 
3.  I am willing to help you, but I may refuse your request.
