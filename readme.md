# My PhD_Dissertation 

Here is my PhD dissertation \LaTeX source. 
Please note that many of the codes are not written by me but from other open-sources.

##*Why* I put things here? 
1. I can trace my progress by the user-friendly Github. 
2. I would like to make it open-source, which might benefit others. 
3. It's saved in reliable cloud. `not onedrive`

##Make use of it
If you would like to make use of some part of it, especially if you are a PhD student from University of Tsukuba, you are encouraged to do so once you agree these statements: 
1.  Paste tex files here everyday as a 'call it a day'. 
2.  Trace my updates. 
3.  Download or export things from here. 

##What I don't do here
1. Figures (Prepare original ai/svg/wmf and exported pdf)
2. Formats (Do it in ShareLatex, or Microsoft Word)
3. References.bib (BibTex file can be exported by Mendeley!)
