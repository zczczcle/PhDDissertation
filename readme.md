# My PhD_Dissertation 

Here is my PhD dissertation \LaTeX source under GNU Public licence. 
Please note that many of the codes are not written by me but from other open-sources. \\

##*Why* I put things here? 
1. I can trace my progress by the user-friendly Github. 
2. I would like to make it open-source, which might benefit others. 
3. It's saved in reliable Git cloud. `I hate MS Office and Onedrive because they lose my documents.`

##Make use of it
If you would like to make use of some \LaTeX source codes of it, especially if you are a PhD student from University of Tsukuba, you are encouraged to use it only when you agree these statements: 
1.  You also follow GNU Public licencing. 
2.  I am not responsible for any problem of your dissertation. 
3.  I am willing to help with your problems, but I may refuse your request.
