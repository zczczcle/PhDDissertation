# PhD_Dissertation for University of Tsukuba

Here is my PhD dissertation LaTeX source licenced by AGPL. 
However, the real contents are licenced by CC 4.0 BY-SA. (And you should take care on the published results according to publishers' terms.)
After my PhD dissertation is opened online by university, I will delete the main texts here. 
Please note that some of the codes are not originally written by me, but from other open-sources.

##Why I put things here? 
I would like to (and I have to because I used AGPL source from suchow) make it open-source, which might save time for a student from University of Tsukuba. 

##Make use of it
If you would like to make use of some LaTeX source codes of it, especially if you are a PhD student from University of Tsukuba, you are encouraged to use it only when you agree these statements: 

1.  You also follow AGPL. 
2.  I am not responsible for any problem of your dissertation, but I would like to help!
