\section{Future perspectives}
\subsection{Look back to histroy to see where we are}
Anthropologist belive that an evolution of mankind would be linked to the use of tools. \cite{lilley1948men} The acients made tools to handle things at meter scale, such as knife, wrench, scythe, sickle. Human civilization histroy is very much related to to development of tools. By updating tools, humankind are able to handle meter scale objects, and gradually a few scales different from our size. The advancement of tools development is directly determined by development of science and technology. 

From millions of years ago, humankind started to updating tools. During prehistroy (beore 3,000 BC) and ancient age (3,000 BC to 476 AC), more and more well made stone, bronze and iron made tools came out to serve human beings for daily use -- at a scale from centimeter to hundreds of meters. In paleolithic age, people are mainly making simple tools; while in neolithic age, people are experienced with applying tools to building constructions. The capability of human beings are still restricted withing 3 scales from ourselves. It is called {\em meter-scale age}. 
In medieval age (476 AC to 1492 AC), the development of classical optics, including the production of well-made lenses, laid the groundwork for microscopy -- the tool to reach microscale and astronomical scale. In modern age (1492 AC to 1789 AC), many revolutionary researches in optics and microscopy are associated and contributed to the fast development of physics, chemistry, biology and material science. It is called {\em micro-scale age}. 
During the last centry, development of partical physics, theory of relativity and quantum mechanics made it possible to see nanoscale world by electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. It is called {\em nano-scale age}.

The important mark between each "scale age" is the invention of optical microscope and electron microscope, because the preliminary important thing to do with the scale is to see objects in that scale. The main activities at early stage of each "scale age" are development of the microscopy itself as well as observing and getting knowledge of the new world objects. The main activities at second stage of each "scale age" is the production of building blocks and applications in that scales. Only when people are very familiar with almost everything in that scale with daily used applications, then science advances might move to the next scale by the rising theories and exiting experiments. 


After developing precised mechanics, human are able to make fine mechanics to operate small objects. The gear was able to transfer larger movement into fine movements. The ratio could be improved by the development of advanced gearing. However, it is not until recent years that people are able to reach nanometer precision on mechanics when piezoelectric motor is available. \cite{} 

Clearly we are now in the cross road between first stage and second stage of the {\em nanoscale age}. 

\subsection{Nanoscale building blocks in future}
Although many researchers claim their nanomaterial samples are perfect and uniform, the quality is not as perfect to perform identical physical or chemical properties. In chapter 6, it is noticed that even the ratios of photo-to-dark current ratios in different states is more or less stable, the photo-to-current ratios of each nanowire is very differnt from each other. The scattered distribution of the ratios is caused by the uniform structural behavior and chemical composition. To use the nanowires in bundles is practical in some applications, while it is not practical to apply them in single nanowire devices as mass production. \\
It is expected that nanoscale building blocks can be really uniform at the nanoscale. What nanoscale building blocks to complicated nanoworld applications is the bricks to the architecture. When the synthesis of various nanoscale building blocks can be well controlled to reach identical morphology, surface and physical, chemical properties. 
Another problem is the understanding of many nanomaterials are not comprehensive. But if the materials are synthesized 

\subsection{Nanomanipulations via microscopy in future}
We are now in 2017, the age of nanotechnology, of gene eneineering, of information technology, artificial intellegence and many more. According to the history of tools, human beings are now quite new to nanometer scale. The tools we are using for the nano world are electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, lithography, piezoelectric probing and other mechanical technologies. It is true that various nanostructures are successfully synthesized, designed electronic chips are in mass production, observations are performed at atomic resolution. However, lithography technology does not work for many other applications, microscopy has sampling limitations, mechanical technology is not mature yet to handle nanoscale building blocks easily.

\end{figure}

During my research for PhD degree, I successfully performed tousands of nanoscale operations mannually. Most processes are based on personal experience. If we are able to translate our experience into codes for machine, it is very possible that machines are able to perform the repeatable operations. In Figure \ref{fig:7_aiworkflow}, an example of automation of nanomanipulation is performed. In this workflow figure, the machine starts from sample loading, and then perform searching of qualified nanostructure targets, followed by automation of microscopy, second qualification check, autofocus and auto-alignment for high resolution imaging, third qualification check, determining location of probe and target sample, approaching and contacting probe to target, electron beam weldering, retract nanostructure target, and many other possible functions. 
Automation of nanoscale handling through SEM and AFM. \cite{Sergej Fatikow}

\subsection{Nanoscale energy storage in future}
Nanomaterials are superior in offering large surface to volume ratios, decent transport properties, variable physical parameters, and confinement effects resulting from the nanoscale dimensions, and have been extensively studied for energy-related applications such as solar cells, thermoelectrics, ion batteries, supercapacitors, and gas storage applications.\\
It is expected that the future energy storage are structurally designed down to nanoscale to fully ultilize the {\em 'plenty of room at the bottom'}. The volumetric capacity could be much higher while at the same time keep the battery stable and safe. 
(1) providing a large surface area to boost the electrochemical reaction or molecular adsorption occurring at the solid–liquid or solid–gas interfaces, (2) generating optical effects to improve optical absorption in solar cells, and (3) giving rise to high crystallinity and/or porous structures to facilitate the electron or ion transport and electrolyte diffusion, so as to ensure that the electrochemical process occurs with high efficiency. It is emphasized that, to further enhance the capability of nanostructured materials for energy conversion and storage, new mechanisms and structures are eagerly awaited. In addition to highlighting the obvious advantages of nanostructured materials, their limitations and challenges for the usage in solar cells, lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen storage systems are also required for further research.\cite{qifengzhang2013csr}\\



%Disadvantages
%1.Nanoparticles may be more difficult to synthesize and their dimensions are difficult to control.
%2.High electrolyte/electrode surface area may lead to more significant side reactions with the electrolyte, and more complications while maintaining interparticle contacts.
