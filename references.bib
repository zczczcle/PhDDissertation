In this paper we compare these results with those for lithium insertion in the same materials and demonstrate the pres- ence of similar alkali metal insertion mechanisms in both cases. Despite the gravimetric capacities being lower for sodium than lithium insertion, we have achieved a reversible sodium capacity of 300 mAh/g, close to that for lithium insertion in graphitic car- bon anode materials.

It also describes calculation of internuclear distances with the soft-sphere model for three crystalline Group 2 fluorides with fluorite structures and fifteen Group 2 crystalline binary salts (oxides, sulfides, selenides and tellurides) with sodium chloride structures. Soft-sphere calculated radii for Group 1 salts are compared with other theoretical radii. Soft-sphere calculated results agree very well with experimental measurements in all cases except for lithium hydride. The probable reasons for the discrepancy with lithium hydride and merits of the soft sphere model are discussed. A simple expression to calculate lattice energies using the soft-sphere radii concept is given and results compared well with lattice energies calculated by the Born-Haber cycle.},

abstract = {Curved ZnO nanowires were deliberately prepared on a Si substrate and the strain effect on their near band edge (NBE) emission was investigated by spatially resolved cathodoluminescence (CL). By moving the electron beam step-by-step across individual curved nanowires and acquiring the CL spectra simultaneously, we found that the NBE emissions from the inner region of the curved nanowires with compressive strain show blueshift, while those from the outer region with tensile strain show redshift. Both the strains have been estimated from the local curvature by a geometrical model and have been further examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. A nearly linear relation between the strain and the peak energy shift in NBE emission was obtained. The result indicates that the optical band gap of ZnO nanowire is quite sensitive to and can be readily modulated by the induced strain via simply curving the nanowire, which has potential applications for designing new optical-electromechanical (OEM) and flexible optoelectronic nanodevices.},

abstract = {Silicon has long been the optimal material for electronics, but it is only relatively recently that it has been considered as a material option for photonics1 . One of the key limitations for using silicon as a photonic material has been the relatively low speed of silicon optical modulators compared to those fabricated from III–V semiconductor compounds2–6 such as lithium niobate7–9 and/or electro-optic materials . To date, the fastest silicon-wave- guide-based optical modulator that has been demonstrated experimentally has a modulation frequency of only ,20MHz (refs 10, 11), although it has been predicted theoretically that a ,1-GHz modulation frequency might be achievable in some device structures12,13 . Here we describe an approach based on a metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure embedded in a silicon waveguide that can produce high-speed optical phase modulation: we demonstrate an all-silicon optical modulator with a modulation bandwidth exceeding 1 GHz. As this technology is compatible with conventional complementary MOS (CMOS) processing, monolithic integration of the silicon modulatorwith advanced electronics on a single silicon substrate becomes possible.},

abstract = {Light emission from semiconductors depends not only on the efficiency of carrier injection and recombination but also extraction efficiency. For ultraviolet emission from high band gap materials such as ZnO, nanowires have higher extraction efficiencies than thin films, but conventional approaches for creating a p-n diode result in low efficiency. We exploited the noncentral symmetric nature of n-type ZnO nanowire/p-type GaN substrate to create a piezoelectric potential within the nanowire by applying stress. Because of the polarization of ions in a crystal that has noncentral symmetry, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal under stress. The piezopotential acts as a "gate" voltage to tune the charge transport and enhance carrier injection, which is called the piezo-phototronic effect. We propose that band modification traps free carriers at the interface region in a channel created by the local piezoelectric charges. The emission intensity and injection current at a fixed applied voltage have been enhanced by a factor of 17 and 4, respectively, after applying a 0.093{\%} compressive strain and improved conversion efficiency by a factor of 4.25. This huge enhanced performance is suggested arising from an effective increase in the local "biased voltage" as a result of the band modification caused by piezopotential and the trapping of holes at the interface region in a channel created by the local piezoelectric charges near the interface. Our study can be extended from ultraviolet range to visible range for a variety of optoelectronic devices that are important for today's safe, green, and renewable energy technology.},

However, the vulnerabilities that Cu NW electrodes have to oxidation, bending, and stretching still present great challenges. This work demonstrates a new Cu@Cu4Ni NW conductive elastomer composite with ultrahigh stability for the first time. Cu@Cu4Ni NWs, facilely synthesized through a one-pot method, have highly crystalline alloyed shells, clear and abrupt interfaces, lengths more than 50 $\mu$m, and smooth surfaces. These virtues provide the NW-elastomer composites with a low resistance of 62.4 ohm/sq at 80{\%} transparency, which is even better than the commercial ITO/PET flexible electrodes. In addition, the fluctuation amplitude of resistance is within 2 ohm/sq within 30 days, meaning that at $\Delta$R/R0 = 1, the actual lifetime is estimated to be more than 1200 days. Neither the conductivity nor the performances of OLED with elastomers as conductive circuits show evident degradation during 600 cycles of bending, stretching, and twisting tests. These high-performance and extremely stable NW elastomeric electrodes could endow great chances for transparent, flexible, stretchable, and wearable electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

abstract = {Silicon is an attractive alloy-type anode material for lithium ion batteries because of its highest known capacity (4200 mAh/g). However silicon?s large volume change upon lithium insertion and extraction, which causes pulverization and capacity fading, has limited its applications. Designing nanoscale hierarchical structures is a novel approach to address the issues associated with the large volume changes. In this letter, we introduce a core?shell design of silicon nanowires for highpower and long-life lithium battery electrodes. Silicon crystalline-amorphous core?shell nanowires were grown directly on stainless steel current collectors by a simple one-step synthesis. Amorphous Si shells instead of crystalline Si cores can be selected to be electrochemically active due to the difference of their lithiation potentials. Therefore, crystalline Si cores function as a stable mechanical support and an efficient electrical conducting pathway while amorphous shells store Li+ ions. We demonstrate here that these core?shell nanowires have high charge storage capacity (?1000 mAh/g, 3 times of carbon) with ?90{\%} capacity retention over 100 cycles. They also show excellent electrochemical performance at high rate charging and discharging (6.8 A/g, ?20 times of carbon at 1 h rate).},

Two companies produced a large array of downstream lithium compounds in the United States from domestic or imported lithium carbonate, lithium chloride, and lithium hydroxide. Domestic production was not published to protect proprietary data. Although lithium markets vary by location, global end-use markets are estimated as follows: batteries, 35{\%}; ceramics and glass, 32{\%}; lubricating greases, 9{\%}; air treatment and continuous casting mold flux powders, 5{\%} each; polymer production, 4{\%}; primary aluminum production, 1{\%}; and other uses, 9{\%}. Lithium consumption for batteries has increased significantly in recent years because rechargeable lithium batteries are used extensively in the growing market for portable electronic devices and increasingly are used in electric tools, electric vehicles, and grid storage applications. Lithium minerals were used directly as ore concentrates in ceramics and glass applications worldwide.},

abstract = {Charges induced in triboelectric process are usually referred as a negative effect either in scientific research or technological applications, and they are wasted energy in many cases. Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge "pump" for driving the flow of electrons in the external load if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3V at a power density of {\~{}}10.4mW/cm 
                        3. TEGs have the potential of harvesting energy from human activities, rotating tires, ocean waves, mechanical vibration and more, with great applications in self-powered systems for personal electronics, environmental monitoring, medical science and even large-scale power. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, a highly sensitive strain sensor with vertically aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire arrays on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film was reported. The device fabrication includes conventional photolithography, metallization, and ZnO nanowire growth through a hydrothermal method. I-V characteristics of the device were highly nonlinear due to the Schottky contact between the nanowire and the gold (Au) electrode. The conductivity of the device is significantly tuned by the change of ZnO/Au Schottky barrier that reflects the strain-induced piezoelectric potential. A gauge factor up to 1813 was obtained from this strain senor, which is higher than the previously reported device based on a lateral ZnO microwire. Theoretical analysis of the piezotronic effect shows that the working nanowire with the largest conductivity change dominates the performance of the device. The non-working nanowire has limited adverse effect on the performance, which explains the robust performance of this novel strain sensor. The stability and fast response of the sensor were also investigated. The sensitive and robust strain sensor is expected to find applications in civil, medical, and other fields. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The specific capacity of MoSe2/rGO anode can reach up to 650mAhg−1 at a current rate of 0.1C in the voltage range 0.01–3.0V (vs. Li/Li+), which is higher than the theoretical capacity of MoSe2 (422mAhg−1). Additionally, the fabricated half cells have shown good rate capability and long cycling stability with 10.9{\%} capacity loss after 600 cycles under a current density of 0.5C.

Calculations are reported for P(4)C(3), PC, and P(3)C(4) and a range of possible structures examined for each. For P(4)C(3), the favored structures are defect zinc-blende structures, while for PC GaSe-like and beta-InS-like structures are lowest in energy. For P(3)C(4), the lowest-energy structure is a beta-C(3)N(4)-like structure, where phosphorus and carbon occupy sites occupied by carbon and nitrogen, respectively, in the nitride. The importance of the local environments of carbon and phosphorus is emphasized and trends in the preferred environments of C and P are analyzed as a function of composition. For carbon-rich structures, a bonding arrangement with four-coordinate hypervalent phosphorus and sp(2) carbon is preferred, while, for higher phosphorus content, structures containing three-coordinate phosphorus and sp(3) carbon are lower in energy. Comparisons are made with the molecular chemistries of carbon and phosphorus, and also with the corresponding nitrogen analogs. Energies of formation, bulk moduli, and band gaps are calculated for the predicted low-energy phases. The stoichiometry with the lowest formation energy (for x(P){\textgreater}0.15) is PC.},

abstract = {To evaluate the potential of Na-ion batteries, we contrast in this work the difference between Na-ion and Li-ion based intercalation chemistries in terms of three key battery properties—voltage, phase stability and diffusion barriers. The compounds investigated comprise the layered AMO2 and AMS2 structures, the olivine and maricite AMPO4 structures, and the NASICON A3V2(PO4)3 structures. The calculated Na voltages for the compounds investigated are 0.18–0.57 V lower than that of the corresponding Li voltages, in agreement with previous experimental data. We believe the observed lower voltages for Na compounds are predominantly a cathodic effect related to the much smaller energy gain from inserting Na into the host structure compared to inserting Li. We also found a relatively strong dependence of battery properties on structural features. In general, the difference between the Na and Li voltage of the same structure, DVNa–Li, is less negative for the maricite structures preferred by Na, and more negative for the olivine structures preferred by Li. The layered compounds have the most negative DVNa–Li. In terms of phase stability, we found that open structures, such as the layered and NASICON structures, that are better able to accommodate the larger Na+ ion generally have both Na and Li versions of the same compound. For the close-packed AMPO4 structures, our results show that Na generally prefers the maricite structure, while Li prefers the olivine structure, in agreement with previous experimental work. We also found surprising evidence that the barriers for Na+ migration can potentially be lower than that for Li+ migration in the layered structures. Overall, our findings indicate that Na-ion systems can be competitive with Li-ion systems.},

In this communication, the electrochemical properties of sodium ion storage in reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were studied in an electrolyte consisting of 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC). The experimental results show that the RGO anode allowed significant sodium ion insertion, leading to higher capacity at high current density compared to the previously reported results for carbon materials. This is due to the fact that RGO possesses higher electrical conductivity and is a more active host, with large interlayer distances and a disordered structure, enabling it to store a higher amount of Na ions. RGO anode exhibits high capacity combined with long-term cycling stability at high current densities, leading to reversible capacity as high as 174.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C (40 mA g-1), and even 93.3 mAh g-1 at 1 C (200 mA g-1) after 250 cycles.

A series of graphenes doped with nonmetal elements was designed and synthesized, and their ORR performance was evaluated in terms of four electrochemical descriptors: exchange current density, on-set potential, reaction pathway selectivity and kinetic current density. It is shown that these descriptors are in good agreement with DFT calculations, allowing derivation of a volcano plot between the ORR activity and the adsorption free energy of intermediates on metal-free materials, similarly as in the case of metallic catalysts. The molecular orbital concept was used to justify this volcano plot, and to theoretically predict the ORR performance of an ideal graphene-based catalyst, the ORR activity of which is comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt catalyst. Moreover, this study may stimulate the development of metal-free electrocatalysts for other key energy conversion processes including hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions and largely expand the spectrum of catalysts for energy-related electrocatalysis reactions.},

abstract = {Nanostructured metal oxides with both anisotropic texture and hollow structures have attracted considerable attention with respect to improved electrochemical energy storage and enhanced catalytic activity. While synthetic strategies for the preparation of binary metal oxide hollow structures are well-established, the rational design and fabrication of complex ternary metal oxide with nonspherical hollow features is still a challenge. Herein, we report a simple and scalable strategy to fabricate highly symmetric porous ternary ZnxCo3-xO4 hollow polyhedra composed of nanosized building blocks, which involves a morphology-inherited and thermolysis-induced transformation of heterobimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. When tested as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, these hollow polyhedra have exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity, excellent cycling stability, and good rate capability.},

abstract = {Graphite, as the most common anode for commercial Li-ion batteries, has been reported to have a very low capacity when used as a Na-ion battery anode. It is well known that electrochemical insertion of Na(+) into graphite is significantly hindered by the insufficient interlayer spacing. Here we report expanded graphite as a Na-ion battery anode. Prepared through a process of oxidation and partial reduction on graphite, expanded graphite has an enlarged interlayer lattice distance of 4.3 {\AA} yet retains an analogous long-range-ordered layered structure to graphite. In situ transmission electron microscopy has demonstrated that the Na-ion can be reversibly inserted into and extracted from expanded graphite. Galvanostatic studies show that expanded graphite can deliver a high reversible capacity of 284 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1), maintain a capacity of 184 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), and retain 73.92{\%} of its capacity after 2,000 cycles.},

abstract = {Silicon is an attractive material for anodes in energy storage devices, because it has ten times the theoretical capacity of its state-of-the-art carbonaceous counterpart. Silicon anodes can be used both in traditional lithium-ion batteries and in more recent Li-O2 and Li-S batteries as a replacement for the dendrite-forming lithium metal anodes. The main challenges associated with silicon anodes are structural degradation and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the large volume change (∼300{\%}) during cycling, the occurrence of side reactions with the electrolyte, and the low volumetric capacity when the material size is reduced to a nanometre scale. Here, we propose a hierarchical structured silicon anode that tackles all three of these problems. Our design is inspired by the structure of a pomegranate, where single silicon nanoparticles are encapsulated by a conductive carbon layer that leaves enough room for expansion and contraction following lithiation and delithiation. An ensemble of these hybrid nanoparticles is then encapsulated by a thicker carbon layer in micrometre-size pouches to act as an electrolyte barrier. As a result of this hierarchical arrangement, the solid-electrolyte interphase remains stable and spatially confined, resulting in superior cyclability (97{\%} capacity retention after 1,000 cycles). In addition, the microstructures lower the electrode-electrolyte contact area, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency (99.87{\%}) and volumetric capacity (1,270 mAh cm(-3)), and the cycling remains stable even when the areal capacity is increased to the level of commercial lithium-ion batteries (3.7 mAh cm(-2)).},

abstract = {Energy production and storage have become key issues concerning our welfare in daily life. Present challenges for batteries are twofold. In the first place, the increasing demand for powering systems of portable electronic devices and zero-emission vehicles stimulates research towards high energy and high voltage systems. In the second place, low cost batteries are required in order to advance towards smart electric grids that integrate discontinuous energy flow from renewable sources, optimizing the performance of clean energy sources. Na-ion batteries can be the key for the second point, because of the huge availability of sodium, its low price and the similarity of both Li and Na insertion chemistries. In spite of the lower energy density and voltage of Na-ion based technologies, they can be focused on applications where the weight and footprint requirement is less drastic, such as electrical grid storage. Much work has to be done in the field of Na-ion in order to catch up with Li-ion technology. Cathodic and anodic materials must be optimized, and new electrolytes will be the key point for Na-ion success. This review will gather the up-to-date knowledge about Na-ion battery materials, with the aim of providing a wide view of the systems that have already been explored and a starting point for the new research on this battery technology.},

The desodiation potentials of Sn anodes are approximately 0.21 V lower than delithiation potentials. The low capacity and poor rate capability of C/Sn anode in Na-ion batteries is mainly due to the large Na-ion size, resulting in slow Na-ion diffusion and large volume change of porous C/Sn composite anode during alloy/dealloy reactions. Understanding of the reaction mechanism between Sn and Na ions will provide insight towards exploring and designing new alloy-based anode materials for Na-ion batteries.},

Here the electrochemical dynamic process of MoS2 nanosheets upon lithium intercalation has been systematically investigated by in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that the lithiated MoS2 undergoes a trigonal prismatic (2H)-octahedral (1T) phase transition with a lithium ion occupying the interlayer S-S tetrahedron site in the 1T-LiMoS2. A pseudoperiodic structural modulation composed of polytype superlattices is also revealed as a consequence of the electron-lattice interaction. Furthermore, the shear mechanism of the 2H-1T phase transition has been confirmed by probing the dynamic phase boundary movement. The in situ real-time characterization at atomic scale provides a great leap forward in the fundamental understanding of the lithium ion storage mechanism in MoS2, which should be also of help for other transition metal dichalcogenides.},

abstract = {Sodium layered oxides NaxCoO2 form one of the most fascinating low-dimensional and strongly correlated systems; in particular P2–NaxCoO2 exhibits various single-phase domains with different Na+/vacancy patterns depending on the sodium concentration. Here we used sodium batteries to clearly depict the P2–NaxCoO2 phase diagram for x≥0.50. By coupling the electrochemical process with an in situ X-ray diffraction experiment, we identified the succession of single-phase or two-phase domains appearing on sodium intercalation with a rather good accuracy compared with previous studies. We reported new single-phase domains and we underlined the thermal instability of some ordered phases from an electrochemical study at various temperatures. As each phase is characterized by the position of its Fermi level versus the Na+/Na couple, we showed that the synthesis of each material, even in large amounts, can be carried out electrochemically. The physical properties of the as-prepared Na1/2CoO2 and Na2/3CoO2 ordered phases were characterized and compared. Electrochemical processes are confirmed to be an accurate route to precisely investigate in a continuous way such a complex system and provide a new way to synthesize materials with a very narrow existence range.},

abstract = {Nowadays, 2D nanosheets or nanoplatelets have attracted great attention due to their wide applications. However, the synthesis of 2D ??-Fe2O3 nanosheets with well-defined hexagonal shape is extremely challenging, because the selective growth along one specific facet is very hard to be realized. In our work, we studied the non-capping ligand mediated reaction within graphene layer chamber, and successfully synthesized ??-Fe2O3 hexagonal nanoplatelets sandwiched between graphene layers (HP-Fe-G). These materials exhibit an improved electrochemical performance compared with the pre-existing ??-Fe2O3 nanoparticles loaded graphene (G-Fe2O3) composites because of the uniqueness of such architectures: thin nanoplatelets, large enough sandwiched spaces to buffer the volume expansion and N-doped graphene. HP-Fe-G delivered an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1100mAh/g after 50 cycles, thus higher than their theoretical value (926mAh/g); while G-Fe2O3 composites showed relatively low capacity retention even after only 20 cycles (582mAh/g). In addition, HP-Fe-G also reveal superior rate capability, 887mAh/g at 1C; in comparison, this value was only 135mAh/g at 1C for G-Fe2O3. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ‘‘metric'' and a special ‘‘preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

It is shown that the total energy functional for US pseudopotentials can be obtained by linearization of two terms in a slightly modified PAW total energy functional. The Hamilton operator, the forces, and the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (H2,H2O,Li2,N2,F2,BF3,SiF4) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, CaF2, Fe, Co, Ni).

abstract = {We report the spectral imaging in the UV to visible range with nanometer scale resolution of closely packed GaN/AlN quantum disks in individual nanowires using an improved custom-made cathodoluminescence system. We demonstrate the possibility to measure full spectral features of individual quantum emitters as small as 1 nm and separated from each other by only a few nanometers and the ability to correlate their optical properties to their size, measured with atomic resolution. The direct correlation between the quantum disk size and emission wavelength provides evidence of the quantum confined Stark effect leading to an emission below the bulk GaN band gap for disks thicker than 2.6 nm. With the help of simulations, we show that the internal electric field in the studied quantum disks is smaller than what is expected in the quantum well case. We show evidence of a clear dispersion of the emission wavelengths of different quantum disks of identical size but different positions along the wire. This dispersion is systematically correlated to a change of the diameter of the AlN shell coating the wire and is thus attributed to the related strain variations along the wire. The present work opens the way both to fundamental studies of quantum confinement in closely packed quantum emitters and to characterizations of optoelectronic devices presenting carrier localization on the nanometer scale.},

By an in-tandem technique using an ultra-sharp tungsten probe as the nanomanipulator and an optical fiber as the optical waveguide the nanoscale CdS/p-Si axial nanowire junctions were fabricated, and in situ photocurrents from them were successfully measured. Compared to a single constituting nanowire, the CdS/p-Si axial nanowire junctions possess a photocurrent saturation effect, which protects them from damage under high voltages. Furthermore, a set of experiments reveals the clear relationship between the saturation photocurrent values and the incident light intensities. The applied technique is expected to be valuable for bottom-up nanodevice fabrications, and the regarded photocurrent saturation feature may solve the Joule heating-induced failure problem in nanowire optoelectronic devices caused by a fluctuating bias.},

abstract = {Based upon the quasi-equilibrium approximation, the validity of p-n junction modelling, has been experimentally investigated under synchronous electrical and optical excitation of silicon photo-diodes. The devices had areas of 8.2 mm(2) and reverse bias saturation currents of the order of 10(-10) A. Their current-voltage (I-V) response was exploited experimentally both in the dark and under various illumination levels. The quoted values for the saturation current, the ideality factor, the series resistance and the reverse-bias photocurrent are investigated for the simulation of the I-V curves via the quasi-equilibrium model. In addition, the measured I-V data have been further analysed to estimate the produced photocurrent as a function of the applied bias (forward or reverse) under given illumination levels. Comparisons between the simulated curves and the experimental data allowed a detailed photocurrent modelling validation. The proposed approach could be useful towards studying other parameters of optically activated p-n junctions such as: the bias dependence of the minority carrier diffusion lengths and/or the generated rates of electron-hole pairs (EHP).},

abstract = {ZnO nanowire (NW) visible-blind UV photodetectors with internal photoconductive gain as high as G approximately 108 have been fabricated and characterized. The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10-9 to 102 s, revealing the coexistence of fast (tau approximately 20 ns) and slow (tau approximately 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t {\textless} 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of ZnO NW photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products (GB) higher than approximately 10 GHz. The high gain and low power consumption of NW photodetectors promise a new generation of phototransistors for applications such as sensing, imaging, and intrachip optical interconnects.},

In nature, the rainforest, consisting of several stereo layers of vegetation, is the highest solar-energy-using ecosystem. Herein, we gave an imitation of the rainforest configuration in nanostructure-based solar cell design. Novel multi-layer nanorainforest solar cells based on p-Si nanopillar array/n-CdS nanoparticles/n-ZnO nanowire array heterostructures were achieved via a highly accessible, reproducible and controllable fabrication process. By choosing materials with appropriate bandgaps, an efficient light absorption and enhanced light harvesting were achieved due to the wide range of the solar spectrum covered. Si nanopillar arrays were introduced as direct conduction pathways for photon-generated charges' efficient collection and transport. The unique strategy using PMMA as a void-filling material to obtain a continuous, uniform and low resistance front electrode has significantly improved the overall light conversion efficiency by two orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that nanorainforest solar cells, along with wafer-scale, low-cost and easily controlled processing, open up substantial opportunities for nanostructure photovoltaic devices.},

abstract = {Aluminum matrix composites loaded with various fractions of multi-walled, well-structured boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), up to 5wt.{\%} fractions, were fabricated using powder constituents by means of a high pressure torsion technique (HPT) at room temperature under 5GPa pressurization. Transient ultrathin amorphous-like layers, with a thickness of 2–5nm, composed of Al(BNO) phases, which formed under severe plastic deformation and developed under further heat treatments of the composites at 350°C and 450°C, were detected at the interfacial regions between Al grains and tightly embracing them BN layers. Room temperature hardness and tensile tests on fabricated composites before and after heat treatments were conducted. The highest value of room temperature tensile strength was obtained on Al-5wt.{\%} BNNT samples annealed at 450°C, that reached up to {\~{}}420MPa, thus exhibiting more than a doubled increase in strength compared to HPT-fabricated pure Al samples under identical compacting conditions.},

abstract = {Gold is known as a shiny, yellow noble metal that does not tarnish, has a face centred cubic structure, is non-magnetic and melts at 1336 K. However, a small sample of the same gold is quite different, providing it is tiny enough: 10 nm particles absorb green light and thus appear red. The melting temperature decreases dramatically as the size goes down. Moreover, gold ceases to be noble, and 2–3 nm nanoparticles are excellent catalysts which also exhibit considerable magnetism. At this size they are still metallic, but smaller ones turn into insulators. Their equilibrium structure changes to icosahedral symmetry, or they are even hollow or planar, depending on size. The present tutorial review intends to explain the origin of this special behaviour of nanomaterials.},

abstract = {A theory of saturation photocurrent and photovoltage has been developed for p‐n junction solar cells. The theory is based on ambipolar transport equations for electrons and holes near the junction, and on empirical models for band‐gap narrowing and Fermi–Dirac integrals. It is applicable to solar cells made of nondegenerate or lowly degenerate semiconductors with position dependent band structures. Interestingly, it includes provision of both short‐circuit and open‐circuit configurations and involves the use of boundary conditions valid at the junction for all levels of injection. The boundary conditions automatically reduce to those of Dhariwal et al. for nondegenerate semiconductors with uniform doping. The empirical models for band‐gap narrowing and Fermi‐Dirac integrals are found to be significantly accurate when compared with available experiments or with exact results. Numerical calculations have been carried out for a number of silicon solar cells possessing varied doping levels, and the results have been found to be in good agreement with available experiments. The analysis shows that the saturation photovoltage developed by a p+n solar cell is higher than that developed by an equivalent n+p solar cell, and that the photovoltage is lower than the diffusion potential of the corresponding solar cell.},

This review focuses on a few select aspects regarding these topics, demonstrating that nanostructured materials benefit these applications by (1) providing a large surface area to boost the electrochemical reaction or molecular adsorption occurring at the solid-liquid or solid-gas interface, (2) generating optical effects to improve optical absorption in solar cells, and (3) giving rise to high crystallinity and/or porous structure to facilitate the electron or ion transport and electrolyte diffusion, so as to ensure the electrochemical process occurs with high efficiency. It is emphasized that, to further enhance the capability of nanostructured materials for energy conversion and storage, new mechanisms and structures are anticipated. In addition to highlighting the obvious advantages of nanostructured materials, the limitations and challenges of nanostructured materials while being used for solar cells, lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen storage systems have also been addressed in this review.},

The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30{\%} for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1.

Notably, the ultrahigh capacity slightly larger than the theoretical value was also observed in Cu/LTO at low current density.

abstract = {One-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures (nanowires (NWs), nanotubes, nanopillars, nanorods, etc.) based photodetectors (PDs) have been gaining traction in the research community due to their ease of synthesis and unique optical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Specifically, the physics and technology of NW PDs offer numerous insights and opportunities for nanoscale optoelectronics, photovoltaics, plasmonics, and emerging negative index metamaterials devices. The successful integration of these NW PDs on CMOS-compatible substrates and various low-cost substrates via direct growth and transfer-printing techniques would further enhance and facilitate the adaptation of this technology module in the semiconductor foundries. In this paper, we review the unique advantages of NW-based PDs, current device integration schemes and practical strategies, recent device demonstrations in lateral and vertical process integration with methods to incorporate NWs in PDs via direct growth (nanoepitaxy) methods and transfer-printing methods, and discuss the numerous technical design challenges. In particular, we present an ultrafast surface-illuminated PD with 11.4-ps full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), edge-illuminated novel waveguide PDs, and some novel concepts of light trapping to provide a full-length discussion on the topics of: 1) low-resistance contact and interfaces for NW integration; 2) high-speed design and impedance matching; and 3) CMOS-compatible mass-manufacturable device fabrication. Finally, we offer a brief outlook into the future opportunities of NW PDs for consumer and military application.},

abstract = {We report the first observation of the electronic level scheme in boron (B)- and phosphorus (P)-doped nanowires (NWs). The NWs' morphology dramatically depends on the doping impurity while a few deep electronic levels appear in both kinds of nanowires, independently of the doping type. We demonstrate that the doping impurities induce the same shallow levels as in bulk silicon. The presence of two donor levels in the lower half-bandgap is also revealed. In both kinds of NWs, B- and P-doped, the donor level (0/+) at E(v) + 0.36 eV of the gold-hydrogen complex is observed. This means that the gold diffusion from the NW tip introduces an electronically active level, which might negatively affects the electrical characteristics of the NWs. In P-doped NWs, we observed a further donor level at 0.26 eV above the valence band due to the phosphorus-vacancy pairs, the E-center, well-known in bulk silicon. These findings seriously question both diffusion modeling of impurities in NWs and the technological aspects arising from this.},

abstract = {It has remained a great difficulty and challenge to prepare BN-based porous monoliths (BNPMs) via a facile method. Here, we report a brand-new and high-throughput synthesis of BNPMs through a facile two-step template-free reaction including self-bubbling precursor solidification and high-temperature pyrolysis. The resulting BNPMs with an interconnected open-bubble structure exhibit the highest specific surface area ever reported for the BNPM systems, up to 1406 m2 g-1, and high bulk crush strength of ∼1 MPa. Thanks to the spacious hydrophobic surfaces of the BNPM system, the material was applied for the highly efficient separation-adsorption purification of an oil/water system, demonstrating an excellent adsorption capacity of up to 71-98{\%} (volume-based adsorption capacity) toward a wide selection of oil contaminants. Besides, the present BNPMs were designed as a filtration column which rapidly removed rhodamine B (RB) and Cd(II) pollutants from an aqueous solution under a forced filtration-adsorption process, corresponding to an ultrahigh removal capacity of 554 mg g-1 and 561 mg g-1, respectively. Thus, the obtained BNPMs are envisaged to become a fairly promising adsorbent for water cleaning.},

Owing to their large absorption cross-sections and high sensitivities, nanoplasmonic resonators are used to generate coherent phonons up to terahertz frequencies. Generating, detecting and controlling such ultrahigh frequency phonons has been a topic of intense research. Here we report that by designing plasmonic nanostructures exhibiting multimodal phonon interference, we can detect the spatial properties of complex phonon modes below the optical wavelength through the interplay between plasmons and phonons. This allows detection of complex nanomechanical dynamics by polarization-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, we demonstrate that the multiple vibrational states in nanostructures can be tailored by manipulating the geometry and dynamically selected by acousto-plasmonic coherent control. This allows enhancement, detection and coherent generation of tunable strains using surface plasmons.},

abstract = {Nanosized silicon (Si) has been widely investigated as a promising material for next generation lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes because of its ultrahigh capacity. However, only a few results can satisfy all aspects towards practical application, particularly the problems like low initial Coulombic efficiency, low volumetric capacity, huge volume change ({\textgreater}290{\%}), complicated fabrication methods, and especially low production remain unsolved.

The pores of BN protect the silver particles from aggregation which makes BN/Ag a stable and recyclable SERS substrate.

abstract = {Thin-film structures can reduce the cost of solar power by using inexpensive substrates and a lower quantity and quality of semiconductor material. However, the resulting short optical path length and minority carrier diffusion length necessitates either a high absorption coefficient or excellent light trapping. Semiconducting nanowire arrays have already been shown to have low reflective losses compared to planar semiconductors, but their light-trapping properties have not been measured. Using optical transmission and photocurrent measurements on thin silicon films, we demonstrate that ordered arrays of silicon nanowires increase the path length of incident solar radiation by up to a factor of 73. This extraordinary light-trapping path length enhancement factor is above the randomized scattering (Lambertian) limit (2n(2) approximately 25 without a back reflector) and is superior to other light-trapping methods. By changing the silicon film thickness and nanowire length, we show that there is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination; for nanowire arrays fabricated from 8 mum thick silicon films, the enhanced absorption can dominate over surface recombination, even without any surface passivation. These nanowire devices give efficiencies above 5{\%}, with short-circuit photocurrents higher than planar control samples.},

abstract = {A nanoprocessor constructed from intrinsically nanometre-scale building blocks is an essential component for controlling memory, nanosensors and other functions proposed for nanosystems assembled from the bottom up. Important steps towards this goal over the past fifteen years include the realization of simple logic gates with individually assembled semiconductor nanowires and carbon nanotubes, but with only 16 devices or fewer and a single function for each circuit. Recently, logic circuits also have been demonstrated that use two or three elements of a one-dimensional memristor array, although such passive devices without gain are difficult to cascade. These circuits fall short of the requirements for a scalable, multifunctional nanoprocessor owing to challenges in materials, assembly and architecture on the nanoscale. Here we describe the design, fabrication and use of programmable and scalable logic tiles for nanoprocessors that surmount these hurdles. The tiles were built from programmable, non-volatile nanowire transistor arrays. Ge/Si core/shell nanowires coupled to designed dielectric shells yielded single-nanowire, non-volatile field-effect transistors (FETs) with uniform, programmable threshold voltages and the capability to drive cascaded elements. We developed an architecture to integrate the programmable nanowire FETs and define a logic tile consisting of two interconnected arrays with 496 functional configurable FET nodes in an area of ∼960 $\mu$m(2). The logic tile was programmed and operated first as a full adder with a maximal voltage gain of ten and input-output voltage matching. Then we showed that the same logic tile can be reprogrammed and used to demonstrate full-subtractor, multiplexer, demultiplexer and clocked D-latch functions. These results represent a significant advance in the complexity and functionality of nanoelectronic circuits built from the bottom up with a tiled architecture that could be cascaded to realize fully integrated nanoprocessors with computing, memory and addressing capabilities.},

abstract = {Inorganic nanowires are under intense research for large scale solar power generation intended to ultimately contribute a substantial fraction to the overall power mix. Their unique feature is to allow different pathways for the light absorption and carrier transport. In this publication we investigate the properties of a nanowire array acting as a photonic device governed by wave-optical phenomena. We solve the Maxwell equations and calculate the light absorption efficiency for the AM1.5d spectrum and give recommendations on the design. Due to concentration of the incident sunlight at a microscopic level the absorptivity of nanowire solar cells can exceed the absorptivity of an equal amount of material used in thin-film devices. We compute the local density of photon states to assess the effect of emission enhancement, which influences the radiative lifetime of excess carriers. This allows us to compute the efficiency limit within the frameworkof detailed balance. The efficiency is highly sensitive with respect to the diameter and distance of the nanowires. Designs featuring nanowires below a certain diameter will intrinsically feature low short-circuit current that cannot be compensated even by increasing the nanowire density. Optimum efficiency is not achieved in densely packed arrays, in fact spacing the nanowires further apart (simultaneously decreasing the material use) can even improve efficiency in certain scenarios. We observe absorption enhancement reducing the material use. In terms of carrier generation per material use, nanowire devices can outperform thin-film devices by far.},

We apply this technique to observe the transformation of an amorphous confined Si volume to a single crystal of Si using laser melting. By confinement of the material volume to nanometric dimensions, the entire amorphous precursor is within the laser spot size and transformed into a single crystal. This observation provides a path for laser processing of single-crystal seeds from amorphous precursors, a potentially transformative technique for the fabrication of solar cells and other nanoelectronic devices.},

We found from measuring photoluminescence that the direct bandgap energy of the nanowires changes linearly with the composition of sulfur in the nanowires. These findings show that the bandgap energy of the nanowires can be systematically modulated in the range of 1.7-2.4 eV. The cutoff wavelength of the fabricated optical sensors shifted toward the longer wavelength with increasing sulfur composition.

Given its spatial and temporal resolution, coupled with analytical capabilities, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been the technique of choice in performing atomic structure and defect characterization. A number of approaches have been recently developed to combine these capabilities with in-situ mechanical deformation and electrical characterization in the emerging field of in-situ TEM electromechanical testing. This has enabled researchers to establish unambiguous synthesis-structure-property relations for one-dimensional nanostructures. In this article, the development and latest advances of several in-situ TEM techniques to carry out mechanical and electromechanical testing of nanowires and nanotubes are reviewed. Through discussion of specific examples, it is shown how the merging of several microsystems and TEM has led to significant insights into the behavior of nanowires and nanotubes, underscoring the significant role in-situ techniques play in the development of novel nanoscale systems and materials.},

A visible emission, peaked above 1.5 eV, and a near infra-red emission at 0.8 eV correlate respectively to the direct transition at the $\Gamma$ point and to the indirect band-gap of wurtzite silicon.

abstract = {Substantial effort has been placed on developing semiconducting carbon nanotubes and nanowires as building blocks for electronic devices--such as field-effect transistors--that could replace conventional silicon transistors in hybrid electronics or lead to stand-alone nanosystems. Attaching electric contacts to individual devices is a first step towards integration, and this step has been addressed using lithographically defined metal electrodes. Yet, these metal contacts define a size scale that is much larger than the nanometre-scale building blocks, thus limiting many potential advantages. Here we report an integrated contact and interconnection solution that overcomes this size constraint through selective transformation of silicon nanowires into metallic nickel silicide (NiSi) nanowires. Electrical measurements show that the single crystal nickel silicide nanowires have ideal resistivities of about 10 microOmega cm and remarkably high failure-current densities, {\textgreater}10(8) A cm(-2). In addition, we demonstrate the fabrication of nickel silicide/silicon (NiSi/Si) nanowire heterostructures with atomically sharp metal-semiconductor interfaces. We produce field-effect transistors based on those heterostructures in which the source-drain contacts are defined by the metallic NiSi nanowire regions. Our approach is fully compatible with conventional planar silicon electronics and extendable to the 10-nm scale using a crossed-nanowire architecture.},

abstract = {Pure MnO2 nanowires and MnO2 nanowire/ZnO nanorod array hybrid nanostructure grown on carbon cloth are synthesized through a low temperature solution method for flexible and high performance supercapacitor applications. The MnO2 nanowire/ZnO nanorod hybrid nanostructured electrodes exhibit more than two times higher specific capacitance, and better capacitance retention than those of pure MnO2 nanowire electrodes. For the three-dimensional MnO2 nanowire/ZnO nanorod array hybrid electrode, a high specific capacitance of 746.7 F g-1 (areal capacitance ???41.5 mF cm-2) is obtained at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1, while the specific capacitance of pure MnO2 nanowire electrode is 319.6 F g-1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements also confirm MnO2 nanowire/ZnO nanorod array hybrid electrode has better electrochemical character. The MnO2 nanowire/ZnO nanorod array hybrid electrode shows great cycle stability, it only losses 6.5{\%} of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. The energy density and power density of the hybrid electrode at 2 A g-1 are 63.1 Wh kg -1 and 950 W kg-1, respectively. It is illustrated that the electrochemical performance of MnO2 nanowire electrode has been greatly enhanced with the supporting of ZnO nanorod arrays. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Flexible multi-functional nano/micro-systems with integrated energy units and functional sensing/detecting units on a single chip have gained considerable attention recently due to their optimized maximum functionality within a minimized sized chip and excellent mechanical flexibility and stability. In this work, we present a prototype of a flexible integrated on-chip photodetecting system with a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based in-plane microsupercapacitor and a CdS nanowire-based photodetector. For the system, the optimized electrodes in the microsupercapacitor were utilized as the source and drain electrodes of the CdS photodetector simultaneously, configuring a minimized self-powered-like visible light photodetector system without external power source. Driven by the microsupercapacitor (volumetric capacitance=8.01F/cm3 and energy density=6.204Wh/cm3), current on/off ratios of 34.50 and 79.81 were obtained for the CdS-based photodetector depending on the number of the microsupercapacitors. The performance of the designed systems exhibited stable photo-current response consistent with the conventional one driven by the external power source, demonstrating the feasibility of the flexible integrated photodetector systems, which are promising for further large-scale and integrated applications.},

For a microscopic understanding of this Joule heating sintering method, we studied the entire process in real time inside a transmission electron microscope equipped with a movable electrical probe. We found an onset of Joule heating induced sintering and coalescence of nanoparticles at power levels of 0.1-10 mW/$\mu$m³. In addition, a carbonization of the organic shells that stabilize the nanoparticles were found, with a conductivity of 4 10⁵ Sm⁻¹.},

This article provides a comprehensive review of the inorganic NW based flexible electronics studied in the past decade, ranging from NWs synthesis and assembly to several important flexible device and energy applications, including transistors, sensors, display devices, memories and logic gates, as well as lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells and generators. The integration of various flexible nanodevices into a self-powered system was also briefly discussed. Finally, several future research directions and opportunities of inorganic NW flexible and portable electronics are proposed.},

The dislocations are produced by indentation of dislocation free single crystals and have a-type Burgers vectors (b=1/3[11 (2) over bar0]). They are aligned along [11 (2) over bar0] directions in the basal plane. Our direct correlation between structural and optical properties on a microscopic scale yields two main results: (i) 60degrees-basal plane dislocations show radiative recombination at 2.9 eV; (ii) screw-type basal plane dislocations act as nonradiative recombination centers. We explain the nonradiative recombination by splitting this dislocation into 30degrees partials that have dangling bonds in the core. The dissociation width of these dislocations is {\textless}2 nm.

The spectralphotocurrent of the single NW is measured and the dependence of the polarizationanisotropy $\rho$ (varying from ∼ 0.1 to ∼ 0.55 ) on the absorption wavelength is found to be clearly affected by the core/shell structure. High quantum efficiency values (10{\%} at 600 nm) are obtained which are attractive for a wide range of optoelectronic devices.},

abstract = {The electrical properties of segments of tapered InAs nanowires (NWs) were investigated by in situ transmission electron microscopy with simultaneous I-V measurements using good ohmic contacts, thus excluding experimental artefacts as Joule heating caused by high-resistivity contacts. At low voltage the resistivity of InAs NWs with a diameter larger than 120 nm is constant (∼10(-2) $\Omega$ {\textperiodcentered} cm). When the current is strongly increased a breakdown of the NW occurs close to the cathode side, whereby the main changes are an electromigration of In and a sublimation of As. The critical current density for breakdown was close to 10(6) A cm(-2) in most cases. A Joule heating and electromigration mechanism for the breakdown process is proposed.},

abstract = {Lattice strain is a useful and economic way to tune the device performance and is commonly present in nanostructures. Here, we investigated for the first time the exciton spectra evolution in bent ZnO microwires along the radial direction via high spatial/energy resolution cathodeluminescence spectroscopy at 5.5 K. Our experiments show that the exciton peak splits into multi fine peaks towards the compressive part while retains one peak in the tensile part and the emission peak displays a continuous blue-shift from tensile to compressive edges. In combination with first-principles calculations, we show that the observed NBE emission splitting is due to the valence band splitting and the absence of peak splitting in the tensile part maybe due to the highly localized holes in the A band and the carrier density distribution across the microwire. Our studies may pave the way to design nanophotonic and electronic devices using bent ZnO nanowires.},
